I am a PhD student and Knight Hennessy Scholar at Stanford University in the Social Media Lab where I study the connection between online and offline behaviors, particularly civic engagement. 

Prior to Stanford, I was a Data Scientist at a digital marketing and measurement firm in Minneapolis, MN where I developed and deployed Bayesian machine learning models, conducted A/B testing, and worked with client teams to optimize digital marketing budgets for Fortune 500 companies such as UnitedHealthcare, Coach Bags, Calvin Klein, and Facebook Marketplace. I have also consulted for dozens of statewide, congressional, and local political campaigns. I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I graduated with Comprehensive Honors. 

In my free time I enjoy biking, trying beer, and watching the Milwaukee Bucks and Bayern Munich.
